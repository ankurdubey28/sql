Data Types in MySQL

1. Numeric :
   1.1 Integer - tinyInt(1Bytes) , smallInt(2Bytes), mediumInt(3Bytes), Int/Integer(4Bytes), BigInt(8 bytes)
   1.2 fixed point - float(4 bytes) , double(8 bytes)
   1.3 floating point - decimal(p,s) -> p means precision and s means numbers to be stored after decimal. 


2. String :
   2.1 char(n) - fixed length string , max length is 255 characters, right paded with spaces if smaller string is entered.
   2.2 varchar(n) - actual size taken dependes on input string (+1-2 bytes) , thus better in terms of space in comparison to char. Limit is 65,535.
   2.3 tinytext - store small text like comments or description , size 255 bytes.
   2.4 text - store text inputs like posts and articles , 65,535 bytes is limit , and indexing does not work well with text type , works fine with varchar(n).
   2.5 mediumtext - long blogs and long articles.
   2.6 long text - document storage and larget text dumps.
   2.7 enum("x","y","z") - same as enums in programming languages, only one of the enum values can be assigned to an entry.
	2.7.7 text, mediumtext ,longtext are stored outside the table and associated using pointer.
   2.8 set("x","y","z") - similar to enums but from 0 to all values in set , anything between this range can be assigend to an entry.



3. Date and Time
   3.1 Date - 3 bytes for yyyy-mm-dd format.
   3.2 DateTime - 8 bytes for yyyy-mm-dd::h-m-s
   3.3 TimeStamp - 4 bytes and same format as DateTime but store in UTC format , that is does automatically convert to and from to local utc format of the machine where data is being retrieved.
   3.4 Time - 3 bytes in format in h.min.sec
   3.5 year - 1 byte simply for year in yyyy format example -> 20002

4. Binary Data types : very obvious , data is stored in binary format
   4.1 bit(n) – store bit values (1–64), e.g. bit(1) = boolean (0/1).
   4.2 binary(n) – fixed length binary string (max 255 bytes), padded with 0x00.
   4.3 varbinary(n) – variable length binary string (max 65,535 bytes).
	4.3.1 above data types are good for storing small keys , hash data.
   4.4 tinyblob – small binary object, max 255 bytes.
   4.5 blob – binary object up to 65,535 bytes (64 KB).
   4.6 mediumblob – binary object up to 16,777,215 bytes (~16 MB).
   4.7 longblob – binary object up to 4,294,967,295 bytes (~4 GB).
        4.8.1– blob types are stored outside table with pointer reference (same as text types).
        4.8.2 above data types are specifically used to store large files (videos , pdfs, pictures).
